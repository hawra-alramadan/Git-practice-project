## What I've learned about Git and GitHub:

1. **Git tracks changes**: Git is a version control system that tracks and manages changes in files.
2. **Commit is important**: A commit in Git represents a snapshot of the project at a certain point in time.
3. **Branches help manage different features**: Git allows you to create branches to work on new features without affecting the main project.
4. **Pushing changes**: Git push allows you to send your committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.
5. **Merge changes**: You can merge changes from one branch into another using `git merge` to combine different work done in parallel.
